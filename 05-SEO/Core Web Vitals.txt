       Cumulative Layout Shift. When the page is loaded the content should not fall down because it will cause wrong selection. So the image sizes should be defined in HTML.
2. LCP:

3. FIP:
       First Input Process. When an input is given on the page, the input should be processed fast, suggested time 100 milli seconds.
